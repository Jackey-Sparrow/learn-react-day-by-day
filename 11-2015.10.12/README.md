# state and props

```
Most of your components should simply take some data from props and render it.
However, sometimes you need to respond to user input, a server request or the passage of time. For this you use state.
(大多数的组件只是简单地从props拿到数据，然后渲染它。然而，哟时候你需要和用户输入打交道，服务器端的请求或者异步，请使用state)
Try to keep as many of your components as possible stateless(尽量减少state)
```

state 用于和UI 交互的数据

```
State should contain data that a component's event handlers may change to trigger a UI update.
```

props 则用于datasource

```
Try to use props as the source of truth where possible.
```
